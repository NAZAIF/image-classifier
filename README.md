# Airports Lost and Found Management App

Image Classifier with **Tensorflow** using **Inception-V3** model having a final accuracy of 87%.

Built as backend for my Academic project. The Android app reduces the hustle at Lost and Found departments of airports by classifying items to below following types and thus making the claiming process easy.

The classifier was trained in a [docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

This repo contains only image classifier as this is my part of the work in the team.

The labels are:
- white watch
- green hand bag
- camera
- white wallet
- green watch
- green wallet
- red watch
- mobile
- white hand bag
- passport 
- black wallet
- black watch
- blackbag
- redbag
- laptop
